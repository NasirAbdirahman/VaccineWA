# VaccineWA Mobile App
# This project was created in May 2021 during the height of the coronavirus outbreak. Unfortunately it was not accepted for use by the State of Washington and due to iOS/Google App store restrictions on non-government sponsored Covid-19 apps, I was unable to publish it live. ðŸ˜ž It is now archived. I have not worked on it since May 2021.

# Description
VaccineWA is a Covid-19 Vaccine Finder App for the residents of Washington State. It helps Washingtonians find a covid-19 vaccine in their zipcode. It filters throught a JSON file of all the providers I've gathered and presents the information in a simple, intuitive UI.
The App currently uses a CSV from the WA DOH site,downloaded 3/9/21.It has every single vaccination sites' location and other pertinent information(as of that date).

Features:<br>
â€¢Users can search for providers within a zipCode in the state.<br>
â€¢Users can contact the provider and schedule an appointment, view the Vaccine Types availble at that location(if provided) find directions, email or call ahead.<br>
â€¢Users can view Washingon state's vaccine phases schedule and know when or If they are eligible for a vaccine.<br>
â€¢Users can view the FAQ component that 'hopefully' answers every question residents of the state may have.<br>
