Due to an initial limited supply of vaccine, there is not enough right now to offer it to everyone. This means we had to make tough decisions about who gets the vaccine first. This is called vaccine allocation and prioritization. So far, three COVID-19 vaccines are authorized for emergency use by the FDA. There are also several other vaccines being developed and tested",

        id:3, title: "What is the Washington State COVID-19 Vaccination Plan?", content:"The COVID-19 vaccine is here in Washington. All of the vaccines authorized for emergency use by the FDA are currently being distributed across the state. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) required all states and territories to turn in an interim plan for COVID-19 vaccine distribution on Oct. 16, 2020. These plans are living documents and will change over time as we learn more about the vaccines and figure out the most equitable way to protect people.",
    },
    {//Vaccine Distribution FAQs
        id:4, title: "How will vaccine distribution work?", content:"The CDC primarily will manage the distribution of COVID-19 vaccine. The current plan is to distribute the vaccine through two mechanisms:1)Use of a centralized distributor. 2)Direct shipments to Indian Health Services clinics; pharmacy chains; and large multi-state healthcare systems.As part of this planning effort, the federal government and the state are considering many factors such as prioritization of high-risk groups, vaccine supply and distribution, logistics, safety, and clinical guidance. Because the current top three vaccine candidates all require different temperatures, properly transporting and storing the vaccine at the right temperature is a large concern and big part of the planning. Vaccine distribution will adjust over time as the number of available doses increases, moving from limited to broader populations in a phased approach.",

        id:5, title: "Who are the DOH partners in Washington state?", content:"Since there are numerous decisions to make, we are engaging and coordinating with tribal nations, local government, community leaders, and others partners to develop and implement vaccination efforts. We are doing this because: 1)We need input on prioritization of the initial doses of vaccine, and how to best distribute it.2)We want to support vaccinators in being ready to vaccinate the initial priority groups. ",
    },
    {//Allocation FAQs
        id:6, title: "How do you determine which providers get vaccines each week?", content:"The CDC sets aside a specific number of COVID-19 vaccine doses for each state to distribute, called allocation. Right now, Washington state is not getting enough first and second doses to meet demand. We have to decide how to distribute, or allocate, this limited supply to providers across the state.We ask all vaccine providers to complete a weekly REDCap allocation survey. The survey tells us how many doses providers are seeking for the following week. To decide how to distribute vaccine, we consider: 1)County population size, 2)Populations that each provider serves and how that relates to who is eligible for vaccines. 3)Each provider’s inventory on hand, how many vaccines they administer and how quickly, and success reporting data to the state on time. And 4)number of doses the provider has received in the past.These factors help us decide how to best distribute vaccine across the state. However, supply is limited right now and there is not enough vaccine to go around. We also must ensure that people across the state and in high-risk groups have equitable access to the vaccine. Vaccine providers must fill out the allocation survey every week as accurately as possible. Because supply is limited, filling out the survey does not guarantee that we can give providers the amount of vaccine they ask for. The survey helps us understand providers’ need and capacity, which informs future allocation decisions.",
    },
    {
        id:7, title: "When does DOH know how much COVID-19 vaccine Washington will get each week?", content:"The CDC tells us on Tuesdays how much vaccine we will get for the following week. The federal government now also gives us a 3-week allocation forecast. This is an estimate of how many first and second doses we should expect in the next three weeks. However, the forecast may change if the federal government’s supply changes.",
    },
    {
        id:8, title: "How do providers order vaccine for the next week?", content:"Providers place vaccine orders in the state Immunization Information System (IIS). They should request the number of first and second doses they can give in 7 days.Ordering in the IIS is open between Friday at 5:00 p.m. and Monday at 5:00 p.m. Vaccine arrives the next Monday or Tuesday, one week after ordering.In addition to ordering in the IIS, providers must complete the weekly REDCap survey. This helps DOH decide how to allocate vaccine.",

    {//Planning FAQs
        id:9, title: "How have you planned for the COVID-19 vaccine?", content:"We've been working with the federal government and local partners within Washington to plan for the distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine.

        id:14, title: "Will everyone in Washington be able to get the COVID-19 vaccine?", content:"Due to an initial limited supply of vaccine, we do not have enough right now to offer it to everyone. This means we had to make tough decisions about who gets the vaccine first. This is called vaccine allocation and prioritization. Eventually there will be enough vaccine for everyone who wants it.Two federal groups lead recommendations for vaccine prioritization:The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and MedicineThe CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).On Friday, October 2, the National Academy of Medicine released the “Framework for Equitable Allocation of COVID-19 Vaccine” consensus study report. We are using this report to guide our planning along with guidance from ACIP, who began voting on interim recommendations in a special session on December 1.We are working on finalizing our vaccine allocation and prioritization framework, which is also guided by feedback from the communities, partners, sectors, and industries that are heavily impacted by COVID-19 in Washington state.

Can I get the vaccine?", content:"Yes, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends anyone who previously had COVID-19 to get the vaccine.Data shows it is uncommon to be re-infected with COVID-19 in the 90 days after you were infected, so you might have some protection (called natural immunity). However, we don't know how long natural immunity might last.People who currently have COVID-19 should wait to get vaccinated until they feel better and their isolation period is finished, if possible.People who were recently exposed to COVID-19 should also wait to get the vaccine until after their quarantine period, if they can safely quarantine away from other people. If there is a high risk they could infect others, they may be vaccinated during their quarantine period to prevent spreading the disease.",

Many people in our state will need to wait months to get the vaccine, and these prevention measures are recommended to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 to people who are not yet vaccinated.The COVID-19 vaccines work well, but they are not 100% effective. Some people may get COVID-19 even if they’ve been vaccinated. Vaccine studies have focused mainly on whether the vaccine keeps you from getting COVID-19; they haven’t looked as much into whether the vaccine prevents you from spreading it to others. Until we know more, please continue your prevention measures. We also want to remind you that it’s not too late to get your flu vaccine.
