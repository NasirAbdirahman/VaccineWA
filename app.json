It filters throught a JSON file of all the providers in that zipcode and presents the information in a simple, intuitive UI. Users can search for providers within a zipCode in the state, view the provider's details, the Vaccine Types availble at that provider (if provided), find directions, email or call ahead, and schedule an appointment. They can also view the state's vaccine phases schedule and see a radius of providers within 15 miles of their searched zipcode.",
